this script can :
- disable cores (disabled by default)
- manage the cpu's tdp
- manage the cpu's max temperature

with the following parammeters :
- cpu load (currently, just for cores enabling/disabling)
- running processes

this is the first beta version, this version is usable as it is, i did not notice major bugs
for next versions i will try to create an update script to enable the update of the programm without losing the config or process list

next release would be an "clean release" with maybe no new functions but just some documentation ans scripts to install it and update it easly
